To replicate the results of the paper, you need:

1. Download the British Academic Written English Corpus (BAWE). The dataset is freely available on http://ota.ahds.ac.uk/headers/2539.xml
2. Extract the dataset into the main directory 
3. Run the scripts in the following order:
- sorter.py 
- preprocessbawe.py
- sentencemaker.py
- sent_vec.py

The complete description of options can be checked by using the `-h` option like:

```
python3 sent_vec.py -h
```

**Need to:** 

**- add instructions on how to run the system from the command line,** 

**- explain what variables can be changed/how to do that.**
